* Apply “curves” and other color transformations to simulate the look of old photos, movies, or video games
* Apply geometric transformations to images, perform image filtering, and convert an image into a cartoon-like image
* Recognize hand gestures in real time and perform hand-shape analysis based on the output of a Microsoft Kinect sensor
* Reconstruct a 3D real-world scene from 2D camera motion and common camera reprojection techniques
